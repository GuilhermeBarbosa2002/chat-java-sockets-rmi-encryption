# Java Socket and RMI Forum/Chat Project

This project implements a forum/chat system using Java sockets, Java RMI, and message encryption. It provides a platform for users to exchange messages securely and efficiently.

## Features

- **Socket-based Communication**: Utilizes Java sockets to establish a network connection between the server and clients, enabling bidirectional communication.

- **RMI Integration**: Utilizes Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) for distributed object-oriented communication between the server and clients.

- **Message Encryption**: Incorporates message encryption techniques to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged messages.

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Java sockets, RMI, and encryption techniques.

## Usage

1.Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans).

2.Specify the desired port for the server to run on in the code.

3.Compile and run the server code.

4.Compile and run the client code on multiple clients to connect to the server.

5.Start exchanging messages through the forum/chat system.

## Customization
